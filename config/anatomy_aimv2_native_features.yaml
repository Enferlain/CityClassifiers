# Configuration for training on pre-computed AIMv2 Native feature sequences

# (Used for naming output files/runs)
model:
  base: "AnatomyFlaws"
  rev: "v10.3_adoptaosf_fl_AIMv2Native_3000" # New revision indicating feature mode
  arch: class                      # Still a classification task
  base_vision_model: "apple/aimv2-large-patch14-native"
# --- Data Configuration ---
data:
  mode: features                   # <<< Crucial: Set mode to 'features' >>>
  data_root: ./data                # Root location for data folders
  # <<< Name of the subfolder containing the generated .npz features >>>

  # <<< Validation split count (applied to feature file list) >>>
  val_split_count: 300

# --- Head Model Parameters ---
# (Defines the HeadModel structure in head_model.py)
head_params:
  features: 1024                   # <<< Input features from AIMv2 base (MUST MATCH features) >>>
  pooling_strategy: 'attn'         # Pooling strategy ('attn', 'avg', 'none') for HeadModel input sequences
  hidden_dim: 1024                 # Hidden dimension for the MLP head
  num_res_blocks: 3                # Number of ResBlocks in the head
  dropout_rate: 0.1              # Dropout rate within the head
  output_mode: sigmoid             # <<< Output mode for the head

# --- Attention Pooling Parameters (Only if head_params.pooling_strategy='attn') ---
attn_pool_params:
  attn_pool_heads: 16              # Heads for the Attention Pooling layer in HeadModel
  attn_pool_dropout: 0.1         # Dropout for the Attention Pooling layer

# --- Training Parameters ---
train:
  # --- Training Duration ---
  # (Adjust based on faster training speed - maybe more steps/epochs feasible now?)
  # max_train_steps: 2000            # Example: 5k steps (adjust as needed)
  max_train_epochs: 80           # Can alternatively specify epochs

  # --- Core Settings ---
  # (Can likely use a higher LR now since only training head)
  lr: 1e-4                         # <<< Increased LR from E2E example >>>
  batch: 128                        # <<< Increase batch size significantly - head is small! >>>
  gradient_accumulation_steps: 1   # Example: Accumulate over 4 micro-batches (Effective Batch Size = 32 * 4 = 128)
  precision: "bf16"                # Mixed precision for training head

  # --- Loss Function ---

  # -- Scheduler Arguments --

  # scheduler_min_lr: 1e-7
